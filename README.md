# QRAFT

**Quantitative Risk, Allocation, and Forecasting Toolkit**

QRAFT is an end-to-end quantitative portfolio construction toolkit built around probabilistic, scenario-based thinking. Rather than producing point estimates, every stage of the pipeline, from forecasting through to risk and allocation, works with full distributions of simulated outcomes, each carrying an explicit probability weight.

The goal is a single coherent research environment where forecasting, risk, and portfolio decisions are not siloed tools bolted together, but stages of one integrated, simulation-driven workflow.

## What QRAFT Does

### Research & Forecasting

QRAFT provides a full probabilistic forecasting pipeline for financial time series. Raw price data is preprocessed per-asset (stationarity checks, detrending, deseasoning), a mean and volatility model is selected automatically, and innovations are extracted and used to drive a Monte Carlo simulation. The output is never a single forecast, it is always a set of probability-weighted simulated price paths across all assets and horizons, preserving the full uncertainty in the distribution.

Beyond pure extrapolation, QRAFT supports three simulation methods for forecasting: **bootstrap**, **historical pass-through**, and **Copula-Marginal Adjustment (CMA)**, allowing the user to control the shape of the joint return distribution, stress tail dependence, or impose fat-tailed marginals on specific assets.

### Risk Management

Because every scenario object carries an explicit probability vector, the full simulation output is always available for downstream risk and allocation steps nothing is collapsed to a point estimate prematurely. This also makes it straightforward to encode  **views** directly onto the scenario distribution using **Entropy Pooling**. Rather than discarding scenarios, their probabilities are updated to be consistent with the view (e.g. "AAPL mean return will be below historical average") by solving a minimum KL-divergence problem. Views can be placed on means, volatilities, correlations, or arbitrary moments.

Portfolio-level risk is computed from the simulated loss distribution, supporting both **VaR** and **CVaR** (more coming soon!). Risk attribution is available at the factor level, using top-down exposure estimation, minimum-torsion orthogonalisation, and Euler decomposition to attribute marginal and total risk contributions to each factor.
