> [!TODO] Higher Priority
> - [ ] Learn about stochastic processes and implement 
> - [ ] Add tests for invariance (iid) 
    > - [ ] Add code to calculate time lag invariances 
    > - [ ] Add Kolmogrov-Smirnov test 

> [!TODO] Lower Priority
> - [ ] Pairwise SC measure? Not super needed but would be fun 
> - [ ] Create pretty print for ScenarioProb object 
> - [ ] Finish setting up effective_ranks (helps us know whether our views are fine to use by determining rank of matrix)
> - [ ] Enforce mean_ref when views of mean and std are together 
> - [ ] Change assigned prob plot to always start at 0 
> - [ ] Create different diagnostic plots for each constraint type 
> - [ ] Change less_than plot to colour above/below 
> - [ ] Write own 'estimation' for distributions? 




## Completed
    > - [X] Add SW measure using monte carlo integration 
> - [X] Write classes?  OOP vs DOP? NOT SURE!
> - [X] Organize files in a more logical manner
> - [X] Add data validation/type for Scenario Distributions 
    > - [X] Re-factor the whole thing!! 
    > - [X] Add view on copula/marginal 
> - [X] Constraints:
    > - [X] Class for cma 
> - [X] Implement CMA (copula marginal algorithm) 
    > - [X] Find appropriate copula package
    > - [X] Add fitting marginals - norm  t for now
