    > - [ ] Add view on marginal distribution
    > - [ ] Add view on joint distribution 
    > - [ ] Add view on copula/marginal 
    > - [ ] Re-factor the whole thing!! 

> [!TODO] Lower Priority
> - [ ] Change assigned prob plot to always start at 0 
> - [ ] Create different diagnostic plots for each constraint type 
> - [ ] Change less_than plot to colour above/below 
> - [ ] Organize files in a more logical manner
> - [ ] Write classes?  OOP vs DOP? NOT SURE!
