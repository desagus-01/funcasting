> [!TODO]
> - [ ] Simplify names for entropy pooling methods 
> - [ ] Make sure you understand differences in kl div and relative entrop 
> - [ ] Make entropy pooling more robust 
    > - [ ] Start by making constraints
> - [ ] Make data structure for equalities vs non-equalities for constraints 
> - [ ] Try adding matrix based state smoothing (look at Meucci) 

## Completed
> - [X] Test simple optimization for REP, based on view on mean 
> - [X] Visualize results of different posteriors 
> - [X] Study and implement relative entropy pooling method
> - [X] Add implementation of KL divergence and test 
> - [X] Make sure that time exponential decay works as intended
