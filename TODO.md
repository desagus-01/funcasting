> [!TODO] Higher Priority
> - [ ] Learn about stochastic processes and implement 
> - [ ] Add tests for invariance (iid) 
    > - [ ] Look at other tests of iid

**Break Down of Stochastic Process**
1. Validation (Tests)
2. Estimation
3. Foreacasting

> [!TODO] Lower Priority
> - [ ] Create a 'prior' object to be used on ScenarioDist 
> - [ ] Pairwise SC measure? Not super needed but would be fun 
> - [ ] Create pretty print for ScenarioProb object 
> - [ ] Finish setting up effective_ranks (helps us know whether our views are fine to use by determining rank of matrix)
> - [ ] Enforce mean_ref when views of mean and std are together 
> - [ ] Change assigned prob plot to always start at 0 
> - [ ] Create different diagnostic plots for each constraint type 
> - [ ] Change less_than plot to colour above/below 
> - [ ] Write own 'estimation' for distributions?
