> [!TODO] Higher Priority
> - [ ] Implement CMA (copula marginal algorithm) 
    > - [ ] Class for cma 
> - [ ] Constraints:
    > - [ ] Add view on copula/marginal 
    > - [ ] Re-factor the whole thing!! 

> [!TODO] Lower Priority
> - [ ] Finish setting up effective_ranks (helps us know whether our views are fine to use by determining rank of matrix)
> - [ ] Enforce mean_ref when views of mean and std are together 
> - [ ] Add data validation/type for Scenario Distributions 
> - [ ] Change assigned prob plot to always start at 0 
> - [ ] Create different diagnostic plots for each constraint type 
> - [ ] Change less_than plot to colour above/below 
> - [ ] Organize files in a more logical manner
> - [ ] Write classes?  OOP vs DOP? NOT SURE!
> - [ ] Write own 'estimation' for distributions? 




## Completed
    > - [X] Find appropriate copula package
    > - [X] Add fitting marginals - norm  t for now
