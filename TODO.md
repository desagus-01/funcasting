> [!TODO] Higher Priority
> - [ ] Finish setting up effective_ranks (helps us know whether our views are fine to use by determining rank of matrix)
> - [ ] Constraints:
    > - [ ] Add to mean view so that it only affects one affects selected assets instead of all 
    > - [ ] Try adding 'market' constraint     

> [!TODO] Lower Priority
> - [ ] Change assigned prob plot to always start at 0 
> - [ ] Organize files in a more logical manner
> - [ ] Write classes? 


## Completed
> - [X] Add confidence level layer to views 
> - [X] Finish setting up get_ep_diags, which gets the diagnostics of our optimization us kl div, by using concepts from exponential tilting 
    > - [X] Add information on the metric for constraint (mean etc), include the name, and value (try adding ltex as well?)
> - [X] Add some more visuals  
> - [X] Add effective scenarios 
> - [X] Make view_on_mean work on multiple variables (ie make it a matrix)
